Error.  Polynomial has bad syntax or coefficients are out of range. Error in parser converting polynomial from string: x 1 with n = 0 and p = 2 at ../SourceCode/Primpoly/ppPolynomial.cpp:  lower level parser error: Expecting to see x^ or x or x ^ integer in sentence x 1
This program generates a primitive polynomial of degree n modulo p.

Usage:  Primpoly p n
          where p is a prime >= 2 and n is an integer >= 2

        Primpoly -t <Polynomial to test>, p
          If you leave off the ,p we default to p = 2

        Primpoly -a p n
          Same, but list all primitive polynomials of degree n mod p

        Primpoly -s p n
          Same, but print search statistics too.

Primitive polynomials find many uses in mathematics and communications
engineering:
   * Generation of pseudonoise (PN) sequences for spread spectrum
     communications and chip fault testing.
   * Generating Sobol sequences for high dimensional numerical integration.
   * Generation of CRC and Hamming codes.
   * Generation of Galois (finite) fields for use in decoding Reed-Solomon
     and BCH error correcting codes.
